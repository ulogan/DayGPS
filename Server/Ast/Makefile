# IMPORTANT NOTICE: The graphics database and chart display routines

# This Makefile is included only for convenience. One could easily compile
# Astrolog on a Unix system by hand with the command:
# % cc -c -O *.c; cc -o astrolog *.o -lm -lX11
# Generally, all that needs to be done to compile once astrolog.h has been
# edited, is compile each source file, and link them together with the math
# library, and if applicable, the main X library.
