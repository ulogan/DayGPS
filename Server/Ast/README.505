  (1) It's 100% freeware. :)
  (2) It runs on multiple platforms, such as DOS, Windows, Mac, and Unix.
  (3) The full source code is available.
  (4) Features are accessible from the command line and from shell scripts.
  (5) It offers many features not found in most other programs.

Astrolog system requirements:

For PC's, 640K of RAM and a reasonably recent version of DOS. A math
co-processor chip is recommended for best performance but not
required. Astrolog can take advantage of Ansi text, CGA, EGA, VGA,
and SVGA graphics but they are not required. The program will run on
8088 AT and XT systems and higher x86 processors. The DOS version of
Astrolog may be run from MS Windows in a DOS box.

For compiling the source code for PC's, the Microsoft C compiler
version C6 or later, or Borland Turbo C/C++ compiler version 3.0 or
later. Other compilers should work although one will probably have to
compile out the screen graphics sections.

For the Windows version, at least 2M of RAM and Windows 3.1 or later.
Astrolog for Windows will run under Windows for Workgroups, Windows
'95, and Windows NT. For compiling the Windows version, Microsoft
Visual C version 1.5 or later is recommended, although most any
Windows compiler should work provided it can compile resource files.

For Unix systems, some C compiler is required since ready to run
executables aren't available. Astrolog can take advantage of X11
Windows but they are not required.

Astrolog will compile and work on VMS systems, even with X Windows,
but this isn't officially tested. A .COM makefile script is included.

On the Macintosh Astrolog will compile and run with every feature
except interactive graphics, using for example the Symantec C/C++ 7.0
compiler for the Mac. It will run on any reasonably recent 68K Mac
with 750K free, and will run on PowerMac's in emulation mode.

A few third party ports of Astrolog are publicly available. This
includes a port of Astrolog version 4.00 to OS/2 Presentation Manager
by David Serls, a port of Astrolog 2.25 to the Macintosh but with
interactive graphics by Pascal Lamboley, and an Amiga version.

Where to get Astrolog:

The anonymous ftp site ftp.magitech.com (or magitech.tcastle.is.net),
maintained by J.H. Trott. The directory /pub/astrology/astrolog
contains all executables, documentation, and source code, for DOS,
Windows, Unix, and the Mac. All ephemeris files are available in the
subdirectory /pub/astrology/astrolog/ephem.

The anonymous ftp site oak.oakland.edu (and its mirrors). These are
SimTel sites where the PC Astrolog files may be found in
/SimTel/msdos/entertn in the files ast50dos.zip and ast50src.zip.

The BBS "Astro Net-1" at US phone number 414-481-9976, maintained by
Carl Baewer. This is for PC's only, but has all DOS executables,
source, documentation, and ephemeris files. Downloads are free minus
any long distance charges.

Several versions of Astrolog have been posted to the Usenet newsgroup
comp.sources.misc and hence are available at many other ftp sites
archiving this group. Utilities such as archie can locate these
sites, such as ftp.uu.net. The latest Astrolog release for which this
was done is 4.10, in volume 32. (Older versions are in volumes 37,
30, and 28.) Note that those releases are only in Unix shell archive
format and have no binary files in them.

Right after a new release, the files for Astrolog can usually be
found on the Usenet newsgroup alt.astrology, while the Unix source
may sometimes be found on comp.sources.misc if the version in
question was submitted there, until the articles expire.

Note that the following anonymous ftp sites used to contain astrology
files but don't anymore: hilbert.maths.utas.edu.au, maintained by
Michael Bulmer, and ftp.u.washington.edu.

If none of the above options are available, and one has internet
e-mail access, they may e-mail me below and I can e-mail the files
back. Please indicate what files are sought, e.g. DOS executable,
Windows executable, PC source, Mac executable, or Unix source. If
requesting any binaries, you will need to have the uudecode utility
(or BinHex utility for the Mac) to convert the mail text to binary form.

Astrolog files:

When accessing sites offering Astrolog, one may encounter various
files. Here is a list of them and what they contain, so one will know
which ones to actually download.

  A ready to run MS Windows executable and related files. For most users, this
  is the only file needed. Pkunzip version 2.04 or later required to unpack.

ast50dos.zip -
  A ready to run DOS executable and related files. For most PC users, this is
  the only file needed. Pkunzip version 2.04 or later is required to unpack.

ast50src.zip -
  The source code. Requires a C compiler to use and pkunzip again to unpack.
  Not required to run if you already have the executable above.

ast50mac.hqx -
  A ready to run Macintosh executable and related files. This is just like
  ast50dos.zip but for the Mac. BinHex 4.0 is required to unpack.

ast50unx.shr -
  The source code and other useful files to run. Contains all of the files in
  ast50src.zip, but in Unix shell archive format. Requires the Bourne shell
  command sh or equivalent utility to unpack.

Helpfile.505 -
  The complete documentation for all of Astrolog's features. A copy of this
  file is contained in ast50win.zip, ast50dos.zip, ast50mac.hqx, and

  its beginning. Generally only useful if one is upgrading from several
  versions ago and wants to be updated on the past few releases.

LRZ5_xx, CHI_xx, CPJV_xx -
  Ephemeris files. Not required but provide more accurate positions. The files
  are in groups with xx being a number indicating the time period covered. The
  three files LRZ5_24, CHI_24, and CPJV_24 cover the current and 21st
  centuries. A copy of those three files are contained in ast50win.zip,
  ast50dos.zip, and ast50mac.hqx.
